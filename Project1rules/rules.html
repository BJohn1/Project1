        <strong>See Rules Below:</strong>
        <br><br>
        1. Each player gets dealt 26 cards (half the deck)
        <br><br>
        2. Both players "draw" their top card. The person with the higher card wins that draw, and adds all cards in play to the end of their playable deck. 
        <br><br>
        3. If both players draw a card with the same value, e.g. they both draw 9s, then a war ensues. The played cards are left on the table and each player draws 3 more cards (face down), and then puts a fourth card face up. The comparison of the most current face up cards determines who wins the war and gets all 10 (original 2 + 8 newly played) cards that are on the table at this point. If the face up cards are the same value again, then the war occurs, three more face down, one face up for comparison. now a total of 18 cards are in play. etc.
        <br><br>
        4. First player with 0 cards in their "deck" loses the game.
        <br><br>
        5. If a player doesn't have enough cards in their deck to participate in a war then that player automatically loses. 
        <br><br>
        6. Basically just a bunch of clicking on cards and hoping for some luck! HAVE FUN!
