# Project 1<br>Blake's War Card Game

## Overview

THIS MEANS WAR - **a card game!**

Background. War is a game where 2 opponents split a normal deck of 52 cards. Each opponent plays one card at a time. Whichever played card has the highest value wins and the player with said card gets to collect all cards in play. If both cards in play are of the same value, each player plays 4 more cards and compares the 4th card. The winner takes all cards in play. (if consecutive wars occur then each player continues to play 4 cards at once). A winner(and loser) is declared when one player has 0 cards left or not enough cards to participate in a war. 

EXAMPLES/INSTANCES OF LOGIC: 
1. How Many Cards are left in each players deck?
2. Who has the card with the greatest value?
3. What happens when the cards have equal value (WAR)?
4. What happens to each deck as a result of war?
5. What about a double war, or triple, ...quadruple?
6. What happens when a player doesn't have enough cards to play war? 
7. When does a player lose?

## Planning & Presentation Requirements

- Choice of Game:

      	☐ WAR.

1. **Introduce the Project:**

   ☐ Intro your game by paraphrasing the README.

2. **Demonstrate the Project:**

   ☐ Launch the game by clicking the link in the README: https://wardcardgame.netlify.com/

   ☐ Play the game! If necessary, manipulate the values of variables in the console to ensure a quick win or loss.

3. **Show/discuss your code:**

   ☐ Briefly show the HTML & CSS.

   ☐ Show the JavaScript and discuss your favorite function.

4. **Share the experience:**

   ☐ biggest challenge: Rendering the Tie Game and figuring out the setTimeout Function. Rendering the mobile version of the        game

   ☐ key learnings/takeaways: Most Fun Part was putting the Clint Eastwood gif as the "draw" button. Rendering Images in real-time and Getting Familiar with SetTimeout Function was my biggest takeaway. I felt really proud of myself for working through the logic of consecutive ties. 

5. **Q & A + Feedback**

## Technical Requirements

### Your App Must:

☐ **Render a game in the browser**.

☐ **Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML.** Popup alerts using the `alert()` method are okay during development, but not production.

☐ Include separate HTML, CSS & JavaScript files.

☐ Have **properly indented HTML, CSS & JavaScript**. In addition, vertical whitespace needs to be consistent.

☐ No remaining **dead and/or commented out code** (code that will never be called) .

☐ Have functions and variables that are named sensibly. Remember, functions are typically named as verbs and variables (data) named as nouns.

☐ **Be coded in a consistent** manner. For example, choose between your preference for function declarations vs. function expressions.

☐ **Deploy your game online** using GitHub Pages so that the rest of the world can play your game!

## Necessary Deliverables

☐ The code for **a working game that meets or exceeds the above technical requirements, built by you, and hosted on GitHub Pages** (covered next week).

- **A `README.md` file** with these sections:

  ☐ **\<Your game's title\>**: A description of your game. Background info of the game is a nice touch.

  ☐ **Screenshot(s):** Images of your actual game.

  ☐ **Technologies Used**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS...

  ☐ **Getting Started**: In this section include the link to your deployed game and any instructions you deem important.

  https://wardcardgame.netlify.com/project1rules/rules

  ☐ **Next Steps**: Planned future enhancements (icebox items).

  Fancier Background and CSS Animations (Cards Flipping and Stacking)
  Better Rendering for mobile play
  App Store Deployment
